# Genomic Medicine Sweden 
## About
[Genomic Medicine Sweden](https://genomicmedicine.se/en/) (GMS) was founded in 2018 with the aim of translating innovation in genomics into clinical practice and implementing a sustainable infrastructure for precision medicine in Sweden. GMS receives national funding from the Swedish Innovation Agency, Vinnova, as well as co-funding from the seven regions with university hospitals and the seven Swedish universities medical faculties. We bring together clinicians, researchers, industry, and patient organizations within a single organization with the goals of implementing precision medicine in healthcare and conducting cutting-edge research and development.

Further information is available at the [GMS website](https://genomicmedicine.se/en/about-us/).

## GMS GitHub
This GitHub organisation is the shared resources used by all participating developers within the Genomic Medicine Sweden realm. Here we have code for analytic tools, technical documentation and other resources open for all our members. All code in the GMS organisation is public and collaboration is encouraged.

### Creating new repositories
Since the repositories at the GMS GitHub is for all members, it is important that all new repos are created with verbose information about the intent of the repository and how the content should be used. A good reference for creating excellent technical documentation can be found in the various nf-core GitHub repositories, e.g. [Sarek](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek).

### Branch protection
New repositories should be created with branch protection at least for the main branch. This should include that all commits to the main branch goes through pull-requests, and that they require review from the Code Owners.

### Code Owners
All repositories should have a maintained [Code Owners file](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners). The Code Owners can be individuals, but a preferred way is to set up a develop team and have them all be maintainers and Code Owners of a given repo. An example of this is the [@jasen-devs team](https://github.com/orgs/genomic-medicine-sweden/teams/jasen-devs) and the [JASEN Code Owners](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/jasen/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS).
